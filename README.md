This repo is used for the peer-review process for the submission to the ML4AL ACL workshop (2024). The newly annotated test data as well as the specific sentences used to calculated the IAA can be found here, as well as the code used to train and test the models.

the code_greek_ner file contains the training script for the models. https://github.com/alekkeersmaekers/glaux-nlp is a dependency but some adjustment were made in the "classification" module, which can be found in the folder as well.
